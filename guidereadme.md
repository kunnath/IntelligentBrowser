# Browser-Use Shopping Example - Complete User Guide

## üõçÔ∏è Overview

This guide will walk you through setting up and running the shopping automation example using Browser-Use. You'll learn how to automate e-commerce tasks like searching for products, adding items to cart, and completing purchases using natural language commands.

## üìã What You'll Learn

- How to set up the Browser-Use environment
- Running the shopping automation example
- Understanding the execution flow
- Customizing shopping tasks
- Troubleshooting common issues

## üîß Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- **Python 3.9+** installed
- **Git** for cloning the repository
- **API Key** for OpenAI, Anthropic, or AWS Bedrock
- **Internet connection** for browser automation

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### Step 1: Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd /Users/kunnath/Projects/useme
```
### Step 2: Set Up Python Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```
### Step 3: Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
### Step 4: Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 5: Set Up Environment Variables
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key'
export AWS_BEDROCK_API_KEY='your-api-key'
export ADEEPSEEK_API_KEY='your-api-key'
```
### Step 6: Run the Shopping Automation Example
```bash
python examples/shopping.py
```

## üìÇ File Structure

- `/Users/kunnath/Projects/useme/`
  - `.venv/` - Python virtual environment
  - `examples/` - Contains shopping automation example
  - `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
  - `README.md` - This guide

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

To customize shopping tasks, modify the `shopping.py` script in the `examples` folder. You can change product search queries, specify shopping sites, and adjust automation steps.

## üöß Troubleshooting

- **Issue:** Browser automation fails to start.
  - **Solution:** Ensure you have the latest version of Chrome and ChromeDriver installed.
- **Issue:** API key authentication errors.
  - **Solution:** Double-check your API keys and ensure they have the necessary permissions.

## üìà Performance Tips

- For faster execution, use headless browser mode.
- Limit the number of concurrent browser instances to avoid overwhelming your system.

## üîÆ Next Steps

- Explore advanced Browser-Use features for more complex automation.
- Integrate with other tools and APIs for a complete e-commerce solution.


Happy automating!

# Check if virtual environment exists
ls -la .venv/

# If it doesn't exist, create it
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install browser-use package
cd browser-use
pip install -e .

# Install Playwright browsers
playwright install chromium

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file (use your preferred editor)
nano .env

# Choose ONE of the following:

ADEEPSEEK_API_KEY= sk-your-openai-key-here
# OR
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here
# OR
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-anthropic-key-here
# OR
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-key
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1

# Test if everything is installed correctly
python -c "import browser_use; print('Browser-Use installed successfully!')"

Understanding the Execution Flow
Phase 1: Initialization

[INFO] Initializing Browser-Use Agent
[INFO] Loading LLM model
[INFO] Starting browser session
[INFO] Setting up DOM observer

Phase 2: Task Execution

[INFO] Processing task: "Search for laptop on Amazon"
[INFO] Navigating to amazon.com
[INFO] Locating search box
[INFO] Typing search query: "laptop"
[INFO] Clicking search button

Phase 3: Product Interaction

[INFO] Analyzing search results
[INFO] Selecting product: "MacBook Pro 14-inch"
[INFO] Adding to cart
[INFO] Proceeding to checkout

Phase 4: Completion

[INFO] Task completed successfully
[INFO] Browser session closed
